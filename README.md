## Spiking Forward-Forward

This is a repository for the Spiking Forward-Forward algorithm developed by Boxuan Zhu. The warehouse mainly consists of two parts:

1. reports: Contains final reports and project plan.
3. code: Taking experiments as the basic unit, this folder contains 5 series of experiments for Spiking Forward-Forward - MNIST, FashionMNIST, N-MNIST, SHD and decentralized experiments. There is no difference in the SFF algorithm used in these experiments, only the hyperparameters and whether the STDP module is enabled or not.
